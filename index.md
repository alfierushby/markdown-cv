## Who I am

I am a student who enjoys challenge. Mathematics is prevalent in all scientific subjects, including computer science,
and thus I pertain great importance to understanding and appreciating it. Due to this, I enjoy teaching whenever I can, as it is the best method to learn.
I also undertake many hobbies, such as programming games, piano, and reading.
